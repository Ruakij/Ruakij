## Hi, I'm Ruakij
Of course, that's not my real name. Keeping identities separated gives control and mystery.

I enjoy goofing around and fiddling with projects. 
Most of the projects or activities here are tools or services I use to solve a problem or simply to have fun.

### What Else?
I like Open Source, basically being free to do what i want with the things i own.. that kind of stuff.

## 🛠️ What I Do:
- **Selfhosting**: Autonomy and control.. when i have time to service everything..
- **Development**: Mainly quality-of-life tools for myself, but feel free to use what you need.
- **Tinkering**: It's like playing with bricks all over again!

## 📘 Skills:
- 🌐 **Server & Service Administration**
  - Container deployment and orchestration with tools like **Kubernetes**.
  - DevOps with CI/CD, IaC, and automation.
  
- 💻 **Software Development**
  - Creating services & tools to solve problems.
  
- 🔌 **Hardware Design**
  - Product design and 3D printing.
  - Microcontroller electronics and sensors for IoT/SmartHome.
